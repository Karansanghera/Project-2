# Project-2

The Project started off pretty easy but there were some parts of the tutorial that were difficult because the tutorial was on linux and this project was on github. 
The first trouble I had was not being able to use cal as a command because it exists in linux, not github.I ended up skipping the cal command and continued on with the tutorial.
The next issue I had was when we were saving using tar.gz in backup.sh and the tutorial used files such as "home" and "linuxconfig" and I was confused on what I should use because of the different program I was using. I tried my username instead of "linuxconfig but it did not work so I left it as it was and moved on.
The last problem that occurred was the backup.sh file not having any output. In the tutorial it showed they add "linuxconfig" and "damian" after the ./backup.sh but did not show how they got those two files or what they were supposed to be.
As of now, my backup.sh file is accurate to the one on the tutorial but it does not have the same output as the tutorial.

i have taken a look at your code and i tried to copy and paste it into my git bash and i am not able to get it run. now i understand that his problebly a problem on 
my end i was getting the same isse and i think it is the for loop on the bottem, when i run the function backup wihtout the for loop it runs just fine so my assumption
is that this is a problem with the for loop. even though it is spell one to one like the giving sample form the assingment. if you are haivng an issue with it running 
as well i would recomend look at the loop.
